Summary of Vulnerabilities and Fixes
Identified Vulnerabilities:
SQL Injection: User inputs could potentially include malicious SQL commands.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User inputs could include harmful scripts.
Weak Password Storage: Storing passwords in plain text.
Unauthorized Access: Lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Fixes Applied:
SQL Injection:

Implemented parameterized queries to securely handle user inputs.
Example: Using SqlCommand with parameters in the LoginUser method.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

Added input validation to check for and remove harmful scripts.
Example: IsValidXSSInput method in ValidationHelpers class.
Weak Password Storage:

Used bcrypt for hashing passwords before storing them.
Example: BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.HashPassword in the RegisterUser method.
Unauthorized Access:

Implemented authentication using ASP.NET Identity.
Set up role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
Example: [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] attribute on the AdminController.
How Copilot Assisted in the Debugging Process:
Code Generation:

Copilot provided code snippets for secure input validation, parameterized queries, and password hashing.
Example: Generating the ValidationHelpers class and UserService methods.
Security Best Practices:

Suggested using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for secure API communication.
Example: Implementing JWT token generation and validation in TokenService.
Testing and Debugging:

Assisted in writing test cases to simulate attack scenarios and verify security measures.
Example: Test cases for SQL injection and XSS in TestInputValidation class.
Refinement and Improvement:

Provided prompts to refine code according to OWASP Top 10 guidelines and best practices.
Example: Ensuring modular code structure and comprehensive documentation.
